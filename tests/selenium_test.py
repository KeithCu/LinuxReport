selenium_test.py

Test script to verify Selenium driver timeout and cleanup mechanisms.
Uses 10-second timeout for quick testing without getting impatient.

NOTE: Connection errors like "No connection could be made because the target machine 
actively refused it" are EXPECTED and indicate that the timeout cleanup mechanism 
is working correctly - the WebDriver is being shut down as intended.
