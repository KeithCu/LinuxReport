Cursor Flask plugins suggestions:

## **High Priority Recommendations**


### 2. **Flask-WTF** - Form Security
**Why you need it:** You're using WTForms but missing CSRF protection.
```python
# Current: Basic WTForms without CSRF
class ConfigForm(Form):
    admin_password = PasswordField(label="Admin Password")
```
**Benefits:**
- CSRF protection
- Better form validation
- File upload security
- Session-based form tokens

## **Medium Priority Recommendations**

### 1. **Flask-Compress** - Response Compression
**Why you need it:** Your news aggregation site serves a lot of text content.
**Benefits:**
- Automatic gzip compression
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Better performance
- Works with Flask-Assets


### 3. **Flask-Mail** - Email Notifications
**Why you need it:** For admin notifications about system issues or updates.
**Benefits:**
- Email notifications
- Admin alerts
- Error reporting
- Update notifications

## **Lower Priority but Useful**


### 4. **Flask-Principals** - Role-Based Access
**Why you need it:** For more sophisticated admin roles and permissions.
**Benefits:**
- Role-based access control
- Permission management
- Admin hierarchy
- Better security

### 5. **Flask-SocketIO** - Real-time Features
**Why you need it:** Your chat system could benefit from real-time updates.
```python
# Current: Server-sent events for chat
@flask_app.route('/api/comments/stream')
def stream_comments():
```
**Benefits:**
- Real-time chat updates
- Live notifications
- Better user experience
- WebSocket support

### 6. **Flask-Monitoring** - Application Monitoring
**Why you need it:** You have basic performance tracking that could be enhanced.
```python
# Current: Basic performance stats
def update_performance_stats(render_time):
```
**Benefits:**
- Request monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Health checks

## **Implementation Priority**

1. **Start with Flask-Login** - Security is critical
2. **Add Flask-WTF CSRF protection** - Form security
3. **Implement Flask-Limiter** - Protect your APIs
4. **Consider Flask-SQLAlchemy** - For structured data
5. **Add Flask-Compress** - Performance improvement

## **Not Recommended for Your Use Case**

- **Flask-Admin** - Too heavy for your simple admin needs
- **Flask-RESTful** - Your API is simple enough without it
- **Flask-Babel** - No internationalization needs
- **Flask-OAuthlib** - No OAuth requirements

Your current setup with Flask-Assets is a good start. The most impactful next steps would be improving security (Flask-Login, Flask-WTF) and adding rate limiting (Flask-Limiter) to protect your chat and API endpoints.

Suggestions from O4-mini:
Here are some next‑step ideas that don't appear to be in place yet:

Metrics & monitoring
– Instrument page views, fetch success rates, and feed latencies; plug into Prometheus/Grafana or at least log structured metrics.

Dashboard & charts
– Visualize feed health over time (last‑fetch timestamps, entry counts) with a small admin dashboard.

User‑customizable templates
– Let advanced users tweak the HTML "sitebox" template or column layout via a settings page.

Automated testing
– Introduce pytest/unittest suites for your routes, forms, cache interactions, and utility modules; enforce coverage thresholds.

Server‑side user accounts & persistent settings
– Replace cookie‑only prefs with Flask‑Login (or OAuth) and store each user's favorites, feed order, dark/light mode in a database.

Read/unread and bookmarking
– Track which articles a user has seen and let them "star" or archive items for later.

Full‑text search & filtering
– Index entries (e.g. via Whoosh or Elasticsearch) so users can search across all feeds and filter by keyword, date, or tag.

Scheduled background jobs
– Instead of fetching on demand or thread triggers, use Celery or APScheduler to run periodic feed updates, prune old data, and send alerts.

Notifications & alerts
– Push e‑mail or Slack/Webhook notifications when keywords appear in new items or a feed fails.

API expansion & docs
– Expose a RESTful JSON API for feed listings, entries, and user settings; add Swagger/OpenAPI docs and rate limiting.

Internationalization
– Use Flask‑Babel so UI text and date formatting adapt to user locales.

Containerization & CI/CD
– Add a Dockerfile + docker‑compose, and set up GitHub Actions (lint, tests, build, deploy).
