  - Instrument page views, fetch success rates, feed latencies (Prometheus/Grafana/logging)
  - Performance optimizations: lazy loading images, better caching, mobile performance

  - Flask-SQLAlchemy for structured data
  - Scheduled background jobs (Celery/APScheduler) for periodic feed updates, pruning, alerts
  - Full-text search and filtering (Whoosh/Elasticsearch)
  - API expansion: RESTful JSON API for feeds, entries, user settings; Swagger/OpenAPI docs; rate limiting and API keys

## Plugin & Library Recommendations

- **High Priority**
  - Flask-Login (user authentication)
  - Flask-WTF (form security)
  - Flask-Limiter (rate limiting)
  - Flask-SQLAlchemy (database)
  - Flask-Compress (performance)

- **Medium/Low Priority**
  - Flask-Mail (email notifications)
  - Flask-Principals (role-based access)
  - Flask-SocketIO (real-time features)
  - Flask-MonitoringDashboard (monitoring)

- **Not Recommended**
  - Flask-Admin (too heavy for simple admin needs)
  - Flask-RESTful (API is simple enough)
  - Flask-Babel (no i18n needs yet)
  - Flask-OAuthlib (no OAuth requirements)

---

## Implementation Notes

- Start with security and user management (Flask-Login, Flask-WTF, Flask-Limiter)
- Add database structure (Flask-SQLAlchemy)
- Improve performance (Flask-Compress)
- Expand user features and admin tools as needed

## Example: Flask-MonitoringDashboard Setup

```python
from flask_monitoringdashboard import MonitoringDashboard
from flask_monitoringdashboard.core.config import Config

# Configure for memory-only storage
config = Config()
config.DATABASE = 'sqlite:///:memory:'  # In-memory SQLite
# OR for pure memory (no disk at all):
# config.DATABASE = 'memory://'

# Initialize
dashboard = MonitoringDashboard()
dashboard.init_app(app, config)
```
